            <p><strong>Impressions of Light</strong>: This name reflects both the Impressionist style and how my dad's

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The site will showcase my dad's collection of Impressionist art, which portrays the beauty of
                southeastern Utah. His work highlights local landscapes, rural life, and the rich history of the region.
                This includes scenes inspired by Native American tribes and pioneers who shaped the area. The site will
                feature:
